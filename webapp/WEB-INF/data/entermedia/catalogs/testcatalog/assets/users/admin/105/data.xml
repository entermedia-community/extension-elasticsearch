  <property name="fulltext">EnterMedia TRAINING GUIDE CHAPTER 1 - ACCESSING MATT Chapter Summary: EnterMedia has been created to offer maximum flexibility and accessibility in the storage, retrieval and assessment of your digital assets. The many functions of EnterMedia and step-by-step instructions on how to use it will be covered in these chapters and appendices. The LOG IN page presents a simple and secure method for you to enter the system. In Chapter 6 SETTINGS, as an Administrator, you will learn how to create and set up an account for others to access EnterMedia. LOG OUT is optional (see note below under Log Out) and has its own tab for easy access. Common Terminology: Throughout this guide, and EnterMedia itself, there may be some terminology which you are unfamiliar with or is used in a different context than it would normally be used. Hopefully the below list will clear some things up for you. Asset: A file attachment to a record. Catalog: EnterMedia allows you to set up one or more catalogs in which to create records. Catalogs are unique in that each catalog may have its own distinct set of meta-data, and even its own look and feel. Category: Records may be placed into categories to help organize them into logical groups. Categories are displayed as a tree structure, similar to a file system. Meta-Data: This is a broad term to define all of the information stored about a record. The types of data stored can be completely customized for the user's needs. Record: A "record" is an entry in EnterMedia that may be searched or browsed for, and may contain assets, meta-data, and information about relationships to other records. Normally a record will be a single asset and meta-data concerning that asset. However, it is possible to create a record with no asset attached, or with more than one asset attached. This is to allow for maximum flexibility, giving users the ability to track information on something that may not be a digital file that can be attached to a record. LOGGING IN (LOG IN PAGE) 1.
